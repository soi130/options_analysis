    "I have been trading Options for several years and still wanting to better understand the pricing of the Options, so, as a data analyst, I think I will use some of the DA tools to help me grasp a better picture of Options Pricing.\n",

    "Options is a derivative origanally aim to be used as an insurance for an underlying asset volatility during a certain period of time. And just like any insurances, the buyer need to pay the insurance premium to get insured, but, a million dollar question is, \"How much\" you should pay or sell for an option at a certain time.\n",

    "Since Options premium depends a lot on: \n",
    "- underlying's volatility and \n",
    "- time to expiration \n",
    "This notebook thus aim to map Options premium to both of the factors.\n",

    " * S50H20 -> Means: this is an SET50 Index Future Expired at March 2020.\n",
